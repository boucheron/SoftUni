##Homework: Java Syntax
####Problem 1. Rectangle Area
Write a program that enters the sides of a rectangle (two integers a and b) and calculates and prints the rectangle's area.
####Problem 2. Triangle Area
Write a program that enters 3 points in the plane (as integer x and y coordinates), calculates and prints the area of the triangle composed by these 3 points. Round the result to a whole number. In case the three points do not form a triangle, print "0" as result.
####Problem 3. Formatting Numbers
Write a program that reads 3 numbers: an integer a (0 ≤ a ≤ 500), a floating-point b and a floating-point c and prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters. The number a should be printed in hexadecimal, left aligned; then the number a should be printed in binary form, padded with zeroes, then the number b should be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point, right aligned; the number c should be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point, left aligned.
####Problem 4. Calculate expression
Write a program that reads three floating point numbers from the console and calculates their result with the following formulae:
```
({a^2 + b^2} / {a^2 – b^2})^({a + b + c} / √c)
(a^2 + b^2 - c^3)^(a – b)
```

Then calculate the difference between the average of the three numbers and the average of the two formulae.
####Problem 5. Convert from decimal system to base-7
Write a program that takes an integer number and converts it to base-7.
####Problem 6. Convert from base-7 to decimal
Write a program that converts from a base-7 number to its decimal representation.
####Problem 7. Randomize numbers from N to M
Write a program that takes as input two integers N and M, and randomizes the numbers between them. Note that M may be smaller than or equal to N.
####Problem 8.* Odd and Even Pairs
You are given an array of integers as a single line, separated by a space. Write a program that checks consecutive pairs and prints if both are odd/even or not. Note that the array length should also be an even number.
####Problem 9.* Hit the Target
Write a program that takes as input an integer – the target – and outputs to the console all pairs of numbers between 1 and 20, which, if added or subtracted, result in the target.
####Problem 10. Character Multiplier
Create a method that takes two strings as arguments and returns the sum of their character codes multiplied (multiply str1.charAt (0) with str2.charAt (0) and add to the total sum). Then continue with the next two characters. If one of the strings is longer than the other, add the remaining character codes to the total sum without multiplication.
####Problem 11. Get First Odd or Even Elements
Write a method that returns the first N odd/even elements from a collection. Return as many as you can.
Format: [Get <number of elements> <odd/even>]
