##Homework: Java Collections Basics
####Problem 1. Sort Array of Numbers
Write a program to enter a number n and n integer numbers and sort and print them. Keep the numbers in array of integers: int[].
####Problem 2. Sequences of Equal Strings
Write a program that enters an array of strings and finds in it all sequences of equal elements. The input strings are given as a single line, separated by a space.
####Problem 3. Largest Sequence of Equal Strings
Write a program that enters an array of strings and finds in it the largest sequence of equal elements. If several sequences have the same longest length, print the leftmost of them. The input strings are given as a single line, separated by a space.
####Problem 4. Longest Increasing Sequence
Write a program to find all increasing sequences inside an array of integers. The integers are given in a single line, separated by a space. Print the sequences in the order of their appearance in the input array, each at a single line. Separate the sequence elements by a space. Find also the longest increasing sequence and print it at the last line. If several sequences have the same longest length, print the leftmost of them.
####Problem 5. Count All Words
Write a program to count the number of words in given sentence. Use any non-letter character as word separator.
####Problem 6.	Count Specified Word
Write a program to find how many times a word appears in given text. The text is given at the first input line. The target word is given at the second input line. The output is an integer number. Please ignore the character casing. Consider that any non-letter character is a word separator. 
####Problem 7.	Combine Lists of Letters
Write a program that reads two lists of letters l1 and l2 and combines them: appends all letters c from l2 to the end of l1, but only when c does not appear in l1. Print the obtained combined list. All lists are given as sequence of letters separated by a single space, each at a separate line. Use ArrayList<Character> of chars to keep the input and output lists.
####Problem 8.	Extract All Unique Words
At the first line at the console you are given a piece of text. Extract all words from it and print them in alphabetical order. Consider each non-letter character as word separator. Take the repeating words only once. Ignore the character casing. Print the result words in a single line, separated by spaces.
####Problem 9.	Most Frequent Word
Write a program to find the most frequent word in a text and print it, as well as how many times it appears in format "word -> count". Consider any non-letter character as a word separator. Ignore the character casing. If several words have the same maximal frequency, print all of them in alphabetical order.
####Problem 10.	Cards Frequencies
We are given a sequence of N playing cards from a standard deck. The input consists of several cards (face + suit), separated by a space. Write a program to calculate and print at the console the frequency of each card face in format "card_face -> frequency". The frequency is calculated by the formula appearances / N and is expressed in percentages with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point. The card faces with their frequency should be printed in the order of the card face's first appearance in the input. The same card can appear multiple times in the input, but it's face should be listed only once in the output.
####Problem 11.* Implement Recursive Binary Search
Binary search is an algorithm that works on already sorted arrays. Basically, it goes to the middle element and checks it has to continue searching to the left, or to the right. Return the index of the element, or -1, if the element is not found.
####Problem 12. Calculate N!
Write a program that recursively calculates factorial.
