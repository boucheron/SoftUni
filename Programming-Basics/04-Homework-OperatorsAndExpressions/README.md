##Homework: Operators Expressions and Statements
####Problem 1. Odd or Even Integers
Write an expression that checks if given integer is odd or even.
####Problem 2. Gravitation on the Moon
The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the Earth. Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a given weight on the Earth.
####Problem 3. Divide by 7 and 5
Write a Boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be divided (without remainder) by 7 and 5 in the same time.
####Problem 4. Rectangles
Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s perimeter and area by given width and height.
####Problem 5. Third Digit is 7?
Write an expression that checks for given integer if its third digit from right-to-left is 7.
####Problem 6. Four-Digit Number
Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd (e.g. 2011) and performs the following:
- Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 2+0+1+1 = 4).
- Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our example 1102).
- Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 1201).
- Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 2101).

The number has always exactly 4 digits and cannot start with 0.
####Problem 7. Point in a Circle
Write an expression that checks if given point (x,  y) is inside a circle K({0, 0}, 2).
####Problem 8. Prime Number Check
Write an expression that checks if given positive integer number n (n ≤ 100) is prime (i.e. it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1).
####Problem 9. Trapezoids
Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides a and b and height h.
####Problem 10. Point Inside a Circle & Outside of a Rectangle
Write an expression that checks for given point (x, y) if it is within the circle K({1, 1}, 1.5) and out of the rectangle R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2).
####Problem 11. Bitwise: Extract Bit #3
Using bitwise operators, write an expression for finding the value of the bit #3 of a given unsigned integer. The bits are counted from right to left, starting from bit #0. The result of the expression should be either 1 or 0.
####Problem 12. Extract Bit from Integer
Write an expression that extracts from given integer n the value of given bit at index p.
####Problem 13. Check a Bit at Given Position
Write a Boolean expression that returns if the bit at position p (counting from 0, starting from the right) in given integer number n has value of 1.
####Problem 14. Modify a Bit at Given Position
We are given an integer number n, a bit value v (v=0 or 1) and a position p. Write a sequence of operators (a few lines of C# code) that modifies n to hold the value v at the position p from the binary representation of n while preserving all other bits in n.
####Problem 15.* Bits Exchange
Write a program that exchanges bits 3, 4 and 5 with bits 24, 25 and 26 of given 32-bit unsigned integer.
####Problem 16.** Bit Exchange (Advanced)
Write a program that exchanges bits {p, p+1, …, p+k-1} with bits {q, q+1, …, q+k-1} of a given 32-bit unsigned integer. The first and the second sequence of bits may not overlap.
