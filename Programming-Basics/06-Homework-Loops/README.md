##Homework: Loops
####Problem 1. Numbers from 1 to N
Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 to n, on a single line, separated by a space.
####Problem 2. Numbers Not Divisible by 3 and 7
Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 to n not divisible by 3 and 7, on a single line, separated by a space.
####Problem 3. Min, Max, Sum and Average of N Numbers
Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of n integer numbers and returns the minimal, the maximal number, the sum and the average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point). The input starts by the number n (alone in a line) followed by n lines, each holding an integer number.
####Problem 4. Print a Deck of 52 Cards
Write a program that generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5♠, A♥, 9♣ and K♦). The card faces should start from 2 to A. Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. Use 2 nested for-loops and a switch-case statement.
####Problem 5. Calculate 1 + 1!/X + 2!/X2 + … + N!/XN
Write a program that, for a given two integer numbers n and x, calculates the sum S = 1 + 1!/x + 2!/x2 + … + n!/xn. Use only one loop. Print the result with 5 digits after the decimal point.
####Problem 6. Calculate N! / K!
Write a program that calculates n! / k! for given n and k (1 < k < n < 100). Use only one loop.
####Problem 7. Calculate N! / (K! * (N-K)!)
In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k different members out of a group of n different elements (also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula:

For example, there are 2598960 ways to withdraw 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards. Your task is to write a program that calculates n! / (k! * (n-k)!) for given n and k (1 < k < n < 100). Try to use only two loops.
####Problem 8. Catalan Numbers
In combinatorics, the Catalan numbers are calculated by the following formula:

Write a program to calculate the nth Catalan number by given n (1 < n < 100).
####Problem 9. Matrix of Numbers
Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and prints a matrix like in the examples below. Use two nested loops.
####Problem 10. Odd and Even Product
You are given n integers (given in a single line, separated by a space). Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd elements is equal to the product of the even elements. Elements are counted from 1 to n, so the first element is odd, the second is even, etc.
####Problem 11. Random Numbers in Given Range
Write a program that enters 3 integers n, min and max (min ≤ max) and prints n random numbers in the range [min...max].
####Problem 12.* Randomize the Numbers 1…N
Write a program that enters in integer n and prints the numbers 1, 2, …, n in random order. You might need to use arrays.
####Problem 13. Binary to Decimal Number
Using loops write a program that converts a binary integer number to its decimal form. The input is entered as string. The output should be a variable of type long. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.
####Problem 14. Decimal to Binary Number
Using loops write a program that converts an integer number to its binary representation. The input is entered as long. The output should be a variable of type string. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.
####Problem 15. Hexadecimal to Decimal Number
Using loops write a program that converts a hexadecimal integer number to its decimal form. The input is entered as string. The output should be a variable of type long. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.
####Problem 16. Decimal to Hexadecimal Number
Using loops write a program that converts an integer number to its hexadecimal representation. The input is entered as long. The output should be a variable of type string. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.
####Problem 17.* Calculate GCD
Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of given two integers a and b. Use the Euclidean algorithm (find it in Internet).
####Problem 18.* Trailing Zeroes in N!
Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial of a given number n has at its end. Your program should work well for very big numbers, e.g. n = 100000.
####Problem 19.** Spiral Matrix
Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and prints a matrix holding the numbers from 1 to n*n in the form of square spiral like in the examples below.

n   | matrix 
--- | ------
    | 1 2 3
3   | 8 9 4
    | 7 6 5
